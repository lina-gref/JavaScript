//This simple randomizer was written in about 5 mins. But it saved a lot of time.
//I worked a lot with contact base and I needed to check the API methods of creating and editing the existing entities via Postman.
//In this one, I defined the format of the required field for the contact entity page.
//This is a pre-request script. It must run before your main method executes.
//You can find a 'Pre-request script' tab in your Postman.
//The main HTTP method used is POST.
//Setting globals is necessary to use them in other tabs, such as request Body (in my case, but also in Parameters tab and Tests tab as well)
